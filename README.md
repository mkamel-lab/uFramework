# uFramework
The uFramework is an open and extensible framework that allows for payload-agnostic messaging with a lowered barrier to entry for users of different backgrounds and skill levels. It improves code reusability by abstracting communication, and allows for seamless transition from direct inter-process messaging to pub/sub messaging patterns. The framework natively supports synchronous or asynchronous communication with or without delivery acknowledgements and/or sync/async replies. It is tailored for pluggability but could be optimized for high-speed streaming applications.
